# 🍣 GomenHashai 🐾

![GomenHashai Logo](logo/logo.png)

Keep your Kubernetes cluster safe by ensuring all pod images use digests from a trusted set. GomenHashai verifies image integrity and gently apologizes as it gracefully denies or terminates pods that don’t meet the standard. Gomen Hashai~ 🙇

Built with security 🛡️ in mind, 🍣 GomenHashai ships with strong default protections.


*✨ “GomenHashai” is a playful mix of “Gomen nasai” (ごめんなさい – Japanese for “I’m sorry”) and “Hash,” referencing image digests. Because it says sorry when it denies your pods 😄. 🍣*
