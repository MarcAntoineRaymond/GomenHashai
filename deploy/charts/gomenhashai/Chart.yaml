  Keep your Kubernetes cluster safe by ensuring all container's images use digests from a trusted set. GomenHashai verifies image integrity and gently apologizes as it gracefully denies or terminates pods that don't meet the standard. Gomen Hashai~ 🙇

  Built with security 🛡️ in mind, 🍣 GomenHashai ships with strong default protections.
